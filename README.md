How my emacs/spacemacs setup works
----------------------------------

- always run emacs using one of the batch files in this dir - this sets up env vars as necessary before running:

  * emacs source/binaries located in: _emacs
  * spacemacs files are located in: config\.emacs.d
  * emacs home is config
  
- extra themes located in config/themes


Updating spacemacs (from main repo)
-------------------------------------
git pull
